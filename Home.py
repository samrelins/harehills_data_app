st.title("Harehills: The Data Behind the Narrative")

st.markdown("""
Welcome to an interactive exploration of the Harehills area in Leeds. This project uses publicly available data to examine three key themes: deprivation, crime, and police stop & search operations. The aim of this analysis is to offer a data-driven examination of a neighbourhood often defined by headlines and reputation [1, 2]. By situating local statistics within the broader context of city-wide trends, we can build a more nuanced understanding of how the area is reflected in administrative data.

This external view, shaped by recurring crises and amplified by media, often paints a one-dimensional picture of a "problem" area [1]. It's a narrative rooted in the tangible challenges of high crime rates and deep socio-economic deprivation, with the Gipton & Harehills ward ranking among the most deprived nationally [2, 3].

However, this picture is profoundly incomplete. To its residents, Harehills is a diverse and resilient community, a place celebrated for its vibrant cultural mix and a powerful "grassroots spirit that has been lost in other more invested in parts of the city" [1]. This app provides the raw data to explore the space between these two competing narratives.
